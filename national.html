        Income Segregation in the United States' Largest Metropolitan Areas

    <div class="row subtitle">Segregation Patterns and Trends in Specific Metropolitan Areas</div>
    <div class="row">
        <p class="description">This website provides a look at the patterns and trends in residential income
            segregation over the past forty years in the two dozen most populated metropolitan areas of the
            United States. We focus here on the segregation of families because segregation may be particularly
            consequential for children.  Children are less mobile than adults, so where they live may play a much
            larger role in shaping their experiences, friendships, social interactions, and educational
            opportunities than it may for adults.

        The disappearance of middle class neighborhoods nationwide
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <p class="description">Over the past forty years, income inequality in the United States
            has grown rapidly. The top 1% of earners earned 21% of all income in the United States
            in 2012, <em>two and a half times </em> the 8.4% share they earned in 1970. A family at the 90th
            percentile of the income distribution now earns almost 10 times as much as a family at
            the 10th percentile of the income distribution; in 1970 the same families' incomes would
            have differed by a factor of 6.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <p class="description">One consequence of this rising income inequality has been a similarly sharp
            increase in residential income segregation.  As the chart below illustrates, in 1970, two-thirds
            of American families in large metropolitan areas  lived in middle-income neighborhoods: neighborhoods
            with median incomes between 80% and 125% of the median income in their metropolitan area.  By 2007,
            that number had declined by a third: only 43% of families lived in such neighborhoods. Instead, a
            growing number of families now live in neighborhoods that are either very poor or very affluent.
            Middle-class neighborhoods, like the middle class, are rapidly disappearing.</p>

        <p class="description">
            The data here are from the 1970, 1980, 1990, and 2000 U.S. Census and the 2005-09 American Community
            Survey (we refer to the 2005-09 period as "2007" for simplicity here).  The Census and American Community
            Survey provide information on the distribution of family income in each census tract (a census tract is a
            neighborhood with a population of roughly 4,000 people).
        </p>
        <p class="description">
            For each year, we calculated the median income of families in each of the largest metropolitan areas,
            and the median income of families in each census tract in those metropolitan areas.  We then computed,
            for each of these census tracts, the ratio (r) of the tract's median family income to that of
            its metropolitan area. Based on this ratio, we classified each tract as affluent (r&ge;1.50);
            high-income (1.25&le;r&lt;1.50); high middle-income (1.00&le;r&lt;1.25); low middle-income (0.80&le;r&lt;1.00);
            low-income (0.67&le;r&lt;0.80); or poor (r&lt;0.67).  An affluent neighborhood, therefore, is one where
            more than half of the families have incomes at least one-and-a-half times greater than the median
            income in their metropolitan area. Likewise, a poor neighborhood is one where more than half of the
            families have incomes less than two-thirds of the median income in their metropolitan area.
            These definitions make it possible to compare neighborhood income levels over time, even as the
            income distribution in metropolitan areas changes.  They also allow us to compare patterns across
            metropolitan areas, despite differences in their local income distribution and cost-of-living.

        </p>
        <p class="description">
            In 1970 and 1980, not all areas of the United States were divided into census tracts.
            On the maps on the following pages, these "non-tracted areas" are shown in white, indicating we
            have no income data for those places.  Generally, only sparsely-populated semi-rural regions on
            the periphery of metropolitan areas were non-tracted in 1970 and 1980; the absence of data for
            these places has little effect on the calculation of segregation trends.
