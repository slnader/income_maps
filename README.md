This repository recreates the interactive maps of the patterns and trends in residential income segregation over the past forty years in the two dozen most populated metropolitan areas of the United States. The live graphics can be accessed on the [project site](http://web.stanford.edu/group/scspi/income-segregation-maps/metros.html?page=0), with links to download the data in a different format. The underlying data was created by [Sean F. Reardon](https://ed.stanford.edu/faculty/seanreardon) and [Kendra Bischoff](https://sociology.cornell.edu/kendra-bischoff).
